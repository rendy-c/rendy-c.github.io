        <h1 id="store">The Store</h1>

        <p> Yes, I have a home in an apartment with a T.V, video games, and toys. And yes, we all lived and ate together under that roof. But that store took care of me when my home couldn’t. I remember spending so much of my childhood in that store. My day would start and end there. To be completely honest, I think I spent more time at this specific store than I did at my own house. I remember coming home from school and having my dad making me the best sandwich ever. A bacon egg and cheese on a toasted roll. Crispy, crackly bacon with slightly runny scrambled eggs. Plus, the pièce de résistance: that soft melty cheese. To me it was as if the gods created the perfect snack and I was the person chosen to try it. It would warm me up inside and I felt happy knowing he put his all into it every time.</p>
        <p> Not surprisingly, there was always one constant that ruined my mood all the time. Every day I’d mope around for quite a while with my head inside my chest, all because I didn’t want to do my dreadful homework. I did however make the perfect escape plan: pretend to be sad and my dad just might let me off the hook. Not surprisingly, he’d normally see through my little facade. Little things like playing around with my dad and eating repetitive, yet memorable food, was in my opinion permanently glued to life in a real home. But I was going through those childhood experiences so many hold dear in a little store. They define what my childhood was like, and how my dad’s store wasn’t just a store. My dad’s store meant the world to me. It was my home away from home.</p>
        <p> But a store is just a place where you go buy whatever you need, right? How could it be compared to a home? Most people walk in, maybe look around for a second or two, and search for the object they’ve been forced to acquire. Once they find it, odds are they quickly walk back to the front of the store where the counter is, pay for their groceries, and leave like any other day of the week; it’s typical. Although there’s nothing necessarily wrong with buying then leaving, the issue with it is that you missed what’s really going on. On your way in did you realize the missing people's posters on the door, or the box of freshly bought Pokémon cards everybody used to buy? How about the SunnyD and Kool Aid still there inside the refrigerators? After all those years, they still lay there, as refreshing as always. Perhaps if you had looked up, you may have noticed that those flickering lights have been there since what seemed like the beginning of time. And finally, when making your way back to the counter, appreciate the way this store is alive and hasn’t died down since the first time you came. People continue to talk to each other, items practically tell you to buy them, and the soft breeze continues to gush through the front door every time it opens, giving the place an almost winter time feel. Once you become aware of everything, you see all the aspects of this store that make it more than just a store: the memories of children then young and young now, who still linger around, waiting for their chance to help make more memories</p>
        <p> Other than what the place looked like, there was always one thing that stood out: the smell. It was the smell of working adults, men mostly. I’d always spend so much time there and I saw my dad and his coworkers work day and night. Some days you could see the sweat through their shirts and whenever they’d get too close, it would smell like week-old garbage. What I found amazing about it was that he didn’t care. No matter what I or others thought, he just kept working. I always saw the passion in his eyes as he worked round the clock. This was true for all the people who worked there too. The place had boxes of beer and soda towards the back and everytime I came, people were always working and picking up boxes and hauling them across the store. Sometimes I’d ask myself how they never got bored of doing the same thing over, and over, and over again. One other thing that I can vividly remember is the smell of money. Crisp money, old money, fake money, and all types of coins. They’d have a naturey/fruity smell to them, and by smell alone I was able to differentiate them. The smells of the place and its contents let you know that this was a place where people worked hard to make a living for themselves and for others. It showed me how my father lived that part of his life.</p>
        <p> Another thing that my father was really good at was getting people to come to his store. Whether that be for a drink, something to eat, or even a conversation, people always came looking for something. Looking back, I feel like my dad’s kindness towards others is what drew all those people to his store. No matter who you were or what you did, he was always kind and gave off a warm, loving feel. He was rarely ever rude to somebody and that allowed for so many people to leave happier than they came in. Watching so many others do full one eighties in regards to the way they interact and have fun with others was incredible to me. The store, in my opinion, had that ability to change people. Even now, I know so many people who used to have anger issues, but after living in this area and going to this store so often, they changed completely. The place makes you more positive because of the effect my father had on people. Knowing one man could do so much for this community through his store, gave me and many others a reason to be happier. To be more like him and change others the way he did.</p>
        <p> This store with him working there changed the lives of so many, but also changed the life cultures in the area. Originally, mainly Hispanics would come and buy things since my dad is Dominincan. The keyword here being originally; culture in the area would soon see a change. Over time, we’d start to see more and more people from different backgrounds come in and socialize with one another. Blacks, whites, Asians, Indians, and quite literally every other race imaginable would come to this specific store and I found that amazing. No other place I had ever been to, not even church, could do something like this. Its ability to unite different people together, it was unbelievable. This made it possible for me to learn lots of new things involving the cultures of those who came. I learned about Chinese New Years and why it’s celebrated, how advanced cities in Africa actually were even though I never would’ve thought about them that way, and how cold Russia really is (very). That store on the corner of Riverdale and Williams introduced me to so many different things. Many of which I never would have learned about in such cool ways. It made me who I am and I’m forever grateful to have been there. Maybe when I get older and visit, the store will still stand strong, alongside the childhoods born within.</p>
